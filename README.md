# Splits

Free online tool that splits highland dance competition registrations into age groups with bib numbers.

## Features

## TODO

- read and use selected file name for Championship detection and export filename (e.g. Calgary Premiership 2025 -> Championship [x] + Calgary Premiership 2025 Grouped.csv)
- age group min-size detection (e.g. no less than 5 people)
- input setting to detect scrutineer code from words + age, age from birthday, etc
